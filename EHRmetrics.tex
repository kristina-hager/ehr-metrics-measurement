\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Introduction}

Electronic health record (EHR) systems collect health information about individual patients 
and enable exchange of a patient's information between healthcare providers.
These systems and the overall computerization of healthcare promise to revolutionize the quality, ease and cost of care for consumers and providers alike.
These systems also present a great opportunity for software organizations to deliver EHR systems that will benefit society in meaningful ways and also generate a profit.

% Specific legislation in the United States has paved the way and, in essence, mandated that providers adopt EHR systems.
% PHI definition: https://www.hipaa.com/hipaa-protected-health-information-what-does-phi-include/

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 laid essential groundwork for EHR systems by defining and regulating the exchange of Protected Health Information (PHI) and by establishing certain national standards.
PHI can be found in myriad places and is essentially any information that can positively identify a person and/or connect them to any health care related information.
HIPAA provides protection for PHI and specifies severe criminal and civil penalties for violation of these protections.
Therefore, any EHR system must provide for protection of PHI in compliance with this legislation.
HIPAA also established standards regarding the processing of claims, benefits, pharmacy transactions, and code sets for medical procedures and diagnoses. 
\cite{ehrbook}

The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act of 2009 provided signficant financial incentives for the adoption and \textit{Meaningful Use} (MU) of EHR systems \cite{ehrbook}.
Furthermore, the HITECH Act empowers the Office of the National Health Information Technology Coordinator (ONC) to define requirements for and certify EHR systems \cite{onc-ehr}.
HIPAA also defines how providers can effectively use (as defined in Meaningful Use) these systems to improve quality and efficiency of care and to achieve incentives \cite{ehrbook}.

%An EHR system must be certified by the ONC as having the required functionality in order for the adopting provider to be eligible for incentives.
Medical providers can choose among these certified EHR systems available in the open market and select the system that they feel meets their needs and offers the most attractive return on investment.
Therefore, providers of EHR systems must compete in the marketplace in order to win contracts with medical providers.
Since all EHR systems must achieve the regulated set of functionality to be eligible, vendors must necessarily concentrate on differentiating their systems with regards to non-functional requirements and price.
A cloud-based EHR service is very alluring to providers due to reduced infrastructure costs typically required by cloud solutions \cite{auditingprivacy}.

In this paper, I will discuss cloud-based Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems (EHR-SaaS) for the perspective
of the software community development community. 
This paper may also be of use to a medical provider administrator in charge of selecting such a system.

My goal is to familiarize the reader with the goals of the EHR-SaaS product and the qualities important in an EHR-SaaS product
she may be developing or considering for purchase.
From these qualities, I will suggest a path down the Goals-Question-Metrics (GQM) methodology that can produce metrics relevant for an EHR-SaaS product.
TODO: doing this is TBD. may also get into web metrics.

In section \ref{sec:What is an EHR}, I will present an overview of the definition and goals of an EHR.

In section TODO, I will present an overview of non-functional requirements that are critical to a SaaS product.

In section TODO, I will present the non-functional requirements I suspect are important for an EHR-SaaS product.

In section TODO, I will cover la-tee-daTODO.

\section{What is an EHR?}
\label{sec:What is an EHR}

An EHR is most easily explained as a digital version of a patient's paper chart.
However, an EHR exhbits features well beyond that of an ordinary paper chart.
It will contain real time information from multiple providers from different organizations and be able to be securely and instantaneously shared between authorized users.
Specifically, an EHR will contain a patient's medical history, previous and current diagnoses, medications, treatment plans, immunization dates, radiology images, laboratory results, and test results from many, and ideally all, providers.

An EHR system contains these digital patient histories and enables further sophisticated functions.
For example, an EHR system gives providers access to evidence-based tools to use when making decisions about patient care.
The system also automates and streamlines the provider's workflow. For example, referrals and patient records can be automatically transferred between cooperating providers.
\cite{healthit-ehr}

Sinclair, et. al. state in \cite{auditingprivacy}, that "An EHR is a modern specialization of a CRM (customer relationship management) which specifically focuses on the collection and exchange of electronic health information about individual patients between healthcare organizations".


\subsection{Goals of an EHR}
\label{sec:Goals of an EHR}

The goals of an EHR are oriented around improving the care the patient receives, assuring security and privacy, and enabling further work in evidence-based medicine and in public health objectives: 
\begin{description}
\item[Continuity of Care] - The provision of a comprehensive record of care for the lifetime of every patient and thus a higher level of ongoing healthcare quality
\item[Access and Security] - A means of properly controlling and providing access; standardization and organization
\item[Reduction of Medical Errors] - Reduces errors by eliminating handwritten orders which can be misinterpreted; enable drug-drug interaction validation and cross-referencing of drug allergies and the patient's vital statistics
\item[Increased Patient Access and Awareness] - Patient access portals enable a patient to be aware of and connected to their medical record, their treatments and results
\item[Evidence-Based Medicine] - Collection of patient medical data, treatments and results into connected databases enabled unprecedented research over long period of time
\item[Public Health Reporting] - The collection of patient data as above supports and improves efficiency in public health efforts in areas like tracking and researching communicable illnesses and chronic conditions
\end{description}
% TODO - indent this table

These goals are outlined in many reputable resources. I have drawn my information from \cite{ehrbook}.

\subsection{Non-Functional Requirements of an EHR}
\label{sec:NFR of an EHR}

As mentioned in section \ref{sec:What is an EHR}, an EHR system product must differentiate itself primarily in the area of non-functionality requirements.
In my research, the non-functional requirements that are mentioned repeatedly are:
\begin{description}
	\item[Portability] (of the individual EHR) - ability to accurately and securely transfer the EHR of a patient from once provider to another \cite{ehrbook}
	\item[Security and Privacy] - the data contained in each message is readable only by intended and authorized recipient \cite{ehrbook}, \cite{auditingprivacy}
	\item[Interoperability] - connectivity between different provider organizations and EHR systems \cite{ehrbook}
	\item[Reliability] - orders and records remain in appropriate state and order even in the face of planned or unplanned system downtime  \cite{ehrbook}
\end{description}

% TODO - what about usability here?
