		\textbf{Example 1 - Percentage (Core Measure 1)} \\
		\hline
		\textbf{Objective} \\
		Use computerized provider order entry (CPOE) for medication orders directly entered by a licensed healthcare professional who can enter orders into the medical record per state, local and professional guidelines. \\
		\textbf{Measure} \\
		More than 30 percent of all unique patients with at least one medication in their medication list seen by the Eligible Professional (EP) have at least one medication order entered using CPOE. \\
		\textbf{Exclusion} \\
		Based on ALL patient records: Any EP [eligible provider] who writes fewer than 100 prescriptions during the EHR reporting period would be excluded from this requirement. Exclusion from  this requirement does not prevent an EP from achieving meaningful use. \\

		\textbf{Example 2 - Yes/No (Core Measure 10)} \\
		\hline
		\textbf{Objective} \\
		Implement one clinical decision support rule relevant to specialty or high clinical priority along with the ability to track compliance to that rule. \\
		\textbf{Measure} \\
		Have you implemented one clinical decision support rule relevant to specialty or high clinical priority along with the ability to track compliance to that rule? \\

		\textbf{Example 3 - Proof of Implementation (Menu Measure 1)} \\
		\hline
		\textbf{Objective} \\
		Capability to submit electronic data to immunization registries or Immunization information systems and actual submission according to applicable law and practice. \\
		\textbf{Measure} \\
		Did you perform at least one test of certified EHR technologyâ€™s capacity to submit electronic data to immunization registries and follow up submission if the test is successful (unless none of the immunization registries to which the eligible professional submits such information has the capacity to receive the information electronically), except where prohibited? \\
